##things to do befor V1 release
 make --dryrun work for --playlist/--copynew
 simple safe filename re-writing for feeds like zefrank
 add back bittorrent 3.4 support for debian/ubuntu users
 clean up central classes so people can build against them (this will help us when we start on V2)
 separate command line config from file config (allows alternate front-ends to be built)
 write better docs
 
 ##V2 wishlist
 consolidate download.log and feed.log into proper XML log
 log all info so we can do clever things later
 parser for options like %f to feed name %t to trackname
 use parser to allow clever tagging
 use parser to do clever filename re-writing (save original and new name in log)
 use parser to do clever <post> commands
 build python bindings to C++ libtorrent
 use bindings to build simple bittorent download class (needs to be thread safe)
 rewrite tagging library using python-gstreamer
